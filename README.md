> *The Or4cl3 ecosystem's research demands infrastructure that moves as fast as the ideas. SynapseStorm is the full-stack TypeScript application framework designed for rapid deployment of AI-powered interfaces—React on the edge, Hono on the server, Cloudflare Workers in production, and Drizzle ORM for type-safe data—everything you need to ship Or4cl3-style intelligence to the world.*

## 🧠 What Is SynapseStorm?

SynapseStorm is Or4cl3's **advanced TypeScript application framework** for building and deploying AI-powered web applications at edge scale. It combines React for rich interactive interfaces, Hono for ultra-lightweight server routing, Cloudflare Workers for global edge deployment, and Drizzle ORM for schema-first type-safe database access—all orchestrated with Bun for maximum development velocity.

Designed around functional programming principles and clean architecture, SynapseStorm powers the web-layer infrastructure that Or4cl3's AI research systems surface to users. Every component is composable, every interface is type-safe, and every deployment goes to the edge—because consciousness-level AI deserves infrastructure that doesn't bottleneck it.

## ✨ Key Features

- **⚡ Edge-First Architecture:** Cloudflare Workers deployment for global low-latency AI interfaces—your Or4cl3 system anywhere in the world, instantly.
- **📦 shadcn/ui Component System:** Pre-integrated accessible component library—add what you need, customize without limits.
- **🗺️ Type-Safe Routing (wouter):** Lightweight client-side routing with full TypeScript support.
- **🗄️ Drizzle ORM + Cloudflare D1:** Schema-first database access with auto-generated migrations—structured like your types, deployed like your code.
- **🔧 Bun Runtime:** Package installation, type generation, and dev server at Bun speed—faster than npm, leaner than Node.
- **🧹 Functional Code Style:** Const-first, early-return, switch-over-if—clean, readable, maintainable TypeScript throughout.
- **🤝 Full-Stack TypeScript:** Shared types between client and server—no interface drift, no runtime surprises.

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Generate Cloudflare types + run DB migrations
bun run cf-typegen
bun db:generate
bun db:migrate

# Start dev server
bun dev
```

### Pre-Commit Check
```bash
bun run check  # Verifies types, build, and deployment config
```

### Add Components
```bash
bun x shadcn@latest add button card dialog
# Components land in src/web/components/ui/
```

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Client** | React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, wouter |
| **Server** | Hono, Cloudflare Workers |
| **Database** | Drizzle ORM, Cloudflare D1 (SQLite at edge) |
| **Runtime** | Bun |
| **UI Components** | shadcn/ui |

## 📝 Development Principles

- **Functional programming preferred** — use `const`, avoid `let`
- **Early returns** to reduce nesting and cognitive load
- **Switch statements or key-value maps** over nested if-else
- **Extract types** into separate interfaces
- **Existing libraries over custom implementations**
- **Tests for complex functionality**
